# tree-sitter-xpath: An XPath grammar for tree-sitter

## ⚠️ Should I use this? ⚠️

This project is currently considered alpha. Should **_I_** use this? I certainly am going to try. Should **_you_** use this? If you're feeling brave or want to contribute.

## Current XPath grammar support

_Hopefully_ fully covers XPath 1.0.

## Credits

Quite a lot of this has been derived and adapted from [tree-sitter-xquery](https://github.com/grantmacken/tree-sitter-xquery)
